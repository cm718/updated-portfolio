        <p>Hello, my name is Chris. I currently work for Apple and I decided to start learning to code at the recommendation
          of a friend. He had gone through a coding boot camp at Northwestern University and suggested I explore it as an option.</p>
        <p>I started learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript on my own alrady. I really enjoyed the challenge and sense of success when
          things worked. As the months went by I found myself really loving the learning process. My wife and I began
          to discuss the possibility of a career change. I was learning more about web development as well as the
          wonderful job market that exists for developers.</p>
        <p>I decided that when the next boot camp opened up I would apply and here I am today. I look forward to
          refining what I already know as well as building on my current skills, specifically with Javascript and back
          end development.</p>
